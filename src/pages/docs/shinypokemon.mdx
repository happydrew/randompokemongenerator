## Introduction to Shiny Pokémon

Shiny Pokémon add an extra layer of excitement and joy to your Pokémon adventures. 
With their unique coloration, Shiny Pokémon are rare and treasured finds in the Pokémon world. 
The Random Pokémon Generator offers a chance to discover these special Pokémon, 
giving you the thrill of encountering a Shiny Pokémon.

## Generating Shiny Pokémon
The Random Pokémon Generator randomly generates Shiny Pokémon, adding more fun to your Pokémon adventure. 
You might just stumble upon a delightful surprise – a Shiny Pokémon!
By default, the probability of generating a Shiny Pokémon is set to **1%**, but you can manually adjust this probability. 
In the advanced display options area, find the **`Shiny`** option and enter your desired probability in the input box next to it.

This is a percentage value. Setting the probability to **0** means no Shiny Pokémon will be generated, 
while setting it to **100** means every randomly generated Pokémon will be Shiny. 
The generator provides you with the utmost flexibility, allowing you to fully customize your Pokémon generation experience.

## Display Options for Shiny Pokémon
When a Shiny Pokémon is generated, a popup notification appears by default, congratulating you on your find.

The popup includes a blue button at the bottom left that quickly navigates you to the Shiny Pokémon management area, 
where you can view all your Shiny Pokémon. If you prefer not to see this popup again when generating Shiny Pokémon, 
you can click the **`Not show again`** button at the top right. This button's function is equivalent to unchecking the 
"ShinyTip" option in the display options area.

## Shiny Pokémon Management Area
The Shiny Pokémon management area is located below the Pokémon display area.

Here, you can conveniently view all your Shiny Pokémon.
If you wish to clear all Shiny Pokémon, click the **`❌ Clear your shiny Pokémon`** button on the bottom of 
the Shiny Pokémon management area.
