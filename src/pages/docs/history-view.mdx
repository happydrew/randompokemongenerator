## Important Note on History

History records are only valid within the current open web page and are not saved in the cache. This means if you close and reopen the page, the history will be cleared and start anew. This design consideration ensures the random nature of the tool is preserved and prevents excessive cache usage, which could impact browser performance and user experience.
